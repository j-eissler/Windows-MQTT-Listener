# Windows-MQTT-Listener
This application allows you to shut down your windows computer with an mqtt message.
It was written to be used with a Home Assistant smart home.

# How to use
<ol>
<li>Open 'config.json' and enter your settings. Every setting is explained below:
  - mqtt_user:            Username required to log into your MQTT broker.
  - mqtt_password:        Password required to log into your MQTT broker.
  - mqtt_broker_hostname: Hostname of your MQTT broker
  - hostname:             Hostname of the computer this application is running on. This is used to set the topic this app listens to.
                          Example:
                          Hostname is 'mycomputer'. The shutdown topic is then set to 'mycomputer/shutdown' so this is where you have to publish the shutdown message to.
  </li>
<li>Add this application to windows task scheduler. This allows it to run even before a user is logged in. Use the following settings to make sure it works:
  - Run as User: SYSTEM
  - Trigger: On Startup
  - Action:
    - Run Program
    - Enter path to 'app.exe'
    - **IMPORTANT:** Enter the directory the 'app.exe' file is in to 'Start in (optional)'. Otherwise the process wont start.
  </li>
<li>Send an MQTT message to the shutdown topic and watch your pc shut down.</li>
</ol>
